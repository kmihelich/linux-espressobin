* Marvell armada-3700 GPIO controller

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "marvell,armada3700-gpio".

- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. 2
  entries are expected, one for the general registers,
  one for the interrupt registers.

- interrupts: The list of interrupts that are used for all the pins
  managed by this GPIO bank.

- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller,
  armada3700 gpio interrupt controller are cascaded to root gic interrupt
  controller.

- #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Should be two.
  The first cell is the GPIO number.
  The second cell is used to specify flags:
    bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags:
      1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
      2 = high-to-low edge triggered.
      4 = active high level-sensitive.
      8 = active low level-sensitive.
    Armada-3700 only supports edge type gpio interrupts.

- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller

- ngpios: Number of GPIOs this controller has

- #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number. The
  second cell is reserved for flags, unused at the moment.

Optional:
- gpiobase: The base of the GPIO bank, if not defined the base calculated by
  multiplying the bank ID number by MVEBU_MAX_GPIO_PER_BANK_A3700 (36)
  This option used in Armada-3700 SoC, because the GPIOs count is different between banks
  In Armada-3700: north bridge has 36 GPIOs and south bridge has 30 GPIOs,
  The base of north bridge gpio bank should be 0 and the base of south bridge gpio bank
  should be 36

Example:
		gpio_nb: gpio@13800 {
			compatible = "marvell,armada3700-gpio";
			reg = <0x13800 0x30
				0x13c00 0x20>;
			ngpios = <36>;
			gpiobase = <0>;
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 51 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 52 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 53 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 54 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 57 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 58 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 152 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 153 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 154 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 155 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
